# Simulate rate limiting on APIs published on Azure API Management

## Summary

This sample contains a preset to simulate the rate limit policy for an API published on Azure API Management. Azure API Management allows you to define rate limits for your APIs to prevent abuse and ensure that your APIs are available for all consumers. The rate limit policy allows you to define the number of requests that can be made to an API within a specified time window. When the rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a 429 Too Many Requests response.
