    "shortDescription": "This sample demonstrates how to test failover logic from Azure OpenAI to GitHub Models using Dev Proxy. The sample includes a chat app that attempts to use Azure OpenAI as the primary provider and automatically fails over to GitHub Models when Azure OpenAI is unavailable. Key benefit: You don't need an actual Azure OpenAI deployment to test failover! Dev Proxy simulates Azure OpenAI failures, and the app falls back to GitHub Models using just your GitHub token.",
