# Demo: Simulate random error responses from Microsoft 365 APIs

## Summary

This sample contains a demo web application connected to Microsoft Graph. Using Dev Proxy, you can simulate random errors returned by Microsoft Graph and see how the app handles them.

## Prerequisites

- [Microsoft 365 developer tenant](https://aka.ms/m365/devprogram)
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org)

## Minimal path to awesome

- Get the preset using Dev Proxy by running `devproxy config get demo-m365-randomerror-js`
- Navigate to the Dev Proxy installation folder, and open the `config/demo-m365-randomerror-js` folder
- Create a new Entra app registration (instructions below)
- Start the sample app by running `npx lite-server`
- Start Dev Proxy with the Microsoft 365 preset by running `devproxy -c "~appFolder/config/m365.json"`
- In a web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and interact with the sample app to see how it handles random errors

### <a id="appreg">Configure Azure AD App Registration</a>

There are two ways which you can configure the App Registration required for the samples to work correctly, through automation using either a `bash` or `pwsh` script we provide for you in the `scripts` directory, or manually through Azure Portal.

> Note that the script will create a file called `env.js`, in the root of the `samples` directory. This file contains the client ID of the application registration that is created.

#### <a id="pwsh">PowerShell 7</a>

> The script uses CLI for Microsoft 365 to authenticate with and create the app registration in your tenant, therefore requires nodejs, v8 or greater to be installed

```sh
PS > cd ./samples/
PS > ./scripts/setup.ps1
```

Follow the prompts in the terminal.

#### <a id="bash">bash</a>

> The script uses CLI for Microsoft 365 to authenticate with and create the app registration in your tenant, therefore requires nodejs, v8 or greater to be installed

```sh
$ > cd ./samples/
$ > chmod +x /scripts/setup.sh
$ > ./scripts/setup.sh
```

Follow the prompts in the terminal.

#### <a id="manual">Manual</a>

The following table provides details of how to configure your app registration.

| Property | Value |
| ---- | ---- |
| Name | dev-proxy-samples |
| Account types | Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) |
| Platform type | Single-page application |
| Redirect URIs | http://localhost:3000/withsdk.html <br> http://localhost:3000/nosdk.html |
| API Permissions | Microsoft Graph <br> User.Read.All (Delegate) w/ Admin Consent <br> Presence.Read.All |

After creating the app registration, create a file called `env.js` in the root of the `samples` directory with the following contents, replacing `<clientid>` with the value which can be copied from the portal.

```js
const appId = '<clientid>';
```

## Table of Contents

- [Pre-requisites](#prereqs)
- [Configure Azure AD App Registration](#appreg)
    - [PowerShell 7](#pwsh)

    - [Manual](#manual)
- [Launch Sample](#launch)

## <a id="prereqs">Pre-requisites</a>

All the samples have been designed with keeping dependencies to an absolute minimum, however there are a few things that you will need.

You will need a Microsoft 365 Tenant and be able to use an account that has permissions to create an Azure AD App Registrations in your tenant.

We highly recommend that you use a Microsoft 365 Developer Tenant with content packs installed when testing these samples, you can create a developer tenant by [signing up to the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/m365/).
